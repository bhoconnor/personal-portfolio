        <strong>I am from the blue mountains of the Shenandoah Valley, in VA, and have a deep-running love for</strong> American and Irish folk music, solidarity politics, breakfasts of all kinds, and economix (i.e., economics done differently, like in employee-owned businesses). When I lived in Nashville, TN and built relationships with other Southerners, I increasingly felt a sense of place and purpose in the South. 
        <br id="experience-ish"> 
        </br> 
        In 2016, I made a home in Selma, AL, where there are good folks and there's good work to be done. While there, <strong>I began exploring the intersection of technology and cooperative economics </strong>(more on that journey in the <a href="#backstory-ish">Backstory section below</a>). I moved to Durham in Nov. of 2021 with a new AL puppy, Inis, to start a next season closer to some family and friends. 
      </br> 
      </br> 
        Soon after, <strong>I applied and was accepted into <a href="https://codethedream.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Code the Dream</a>, where I began learning </strong> JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, etc. I <i>finished an advanced React.js course</i> at CTD in March of 2023, followed soon after by a <i>CTD Practicum</i>, where I was a part of a team of 8 who met twice weekly for eight weeks, using principles of Agile development, CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment), and GitHub version control to build a game called "Phrazel" with WebSockets (see more on Phrazel and my other development work in the <a href="#projects-ish">Projects section below</a>. 
      </br>
      </br>
      <strong>After some attempts to make my way into the tech cooperative world--and many job applications--I felt I was hitting a dead-end </strong>(call it age, AI, and/or fate ü§∑üèª). My dream had always been to build some kind of entity--likely a co-op--that helped build local, neighborhood cohesion for the sake of a more democratic society. So I returned to some of my roots, heading back to graduate school in 2024 at UNC Charlotte to build on my master's in community psychology. I'm working to earn a PhD in the field, focusing on understanding and developing practices, interventions, and settings that support social cohesion, sense of community, and both political and economic democracy.

    <h2>Some Backstory</h2>
  
    <p>
      I am new to coding in many ways, though I have always been intrigued by
      technology. <strong> My Mom tells me that when I was a toddler, she felt 
      I might work with computers one day. For me, my first formal involvement in
      tech-related work came through the cooperative sector</strong>--specifically
      through something called "platform cooperatives," where workers and/or
      users have an ownership stake in tech companies. I took a class through
      The New School and Mondgragon University in 2020 called "Platform
      Cooperatives Now." 
      </br> 
      </br>  
      This led me into <strong> a volunteer project seeking to develop a co-op food delivery app. </strong> 
      I was more involved in coordinating the volunteer software developers among us, but it gave me a taste for the grounded quality of building code and the role coding can play in a modern economy. I since applied and was accepted into Code the Dream (CTD), as noted above.
